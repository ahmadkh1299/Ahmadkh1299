# Hi, I'm Ahmad Khalaila! 👋

## About Me

* 🎓 **Education:** B.Sc. Computer Science graduate from Tel Aviv University.
* 💻 **Focus & Passion:** Love building robust backend systems and full-stack applications. I have hands-on experience developing web services, databases, and even low-level system programs.
* 🚀 **Goal:** Actively seeking a junior **Software Developer** role where I can apply my skills in Java, Python, C++ and more to create scalable, efficient software.

## 🌟 Projects

* **Popcorn Palace** – *Movie Ticket Booking API.* A backend system built with **Java Spring Boot** providing RESTful APIs to manage movies, showtimes, and ticket bookings.
